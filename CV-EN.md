## Experience

### Orbis - Digital Tribes
**Principal Researcher | Product Manager in Applied Geospatial Computing Theory**
April 2020 - Present (5 years 9 months)
São Paulo, Brazil

I created www.orbis.social as part of a multi-phase, FAPESP-funded applied computer science research project focused on geospatial computing, collaborative mapping, and digital cultural infrastructure. Backed by PIPE I and PIPE II grants from FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation), I serve as Principal Researcher and lead product architect for the platform.

Orbis.social is a geo-social network that allows communities to collaboratively map their cultural identity over geographic space—supporting features like amorphous territorial boundaries, cultural tagging, and local group discovery across web, iOS, and Android platforms.

I led the full-stack development of the system, managed remote engineering and design teams, coordinated sprint cycles, and directed backend architecture, front-end implementation, and UI/UX strategy. I also oversaw stakeholder reporting, research compliance, user testing, and cross-platform optimization.

To date, Orbis has mapped over 1.7 million cultural zones, reached viral traction with over 1.1 million video views, and has been cited in multiple grant-winning proposals. The platform is currently used as a tool for digital cultural mapping, social infrastructure development, and applied R&D.

This role combines high-level product execution with academic and government research management, allowing me to bridge innovation, public impact, and scalable technology.

### FAPESP
**Principal Researcher – Applied Computer Science (PIPE I & II)**

São Paulo, Brazil

As Principal Researcher and creator of www.orbis.social, I led a multi-phase, FAPESP-funded applied computer science research project focused on geospatial data, mapping systems, and social infrastructure. Selected for both PIPE Phase I and Phase II (the state's most competitive tech innovation programs), the project aimed to develop a scalable geo-social platform for mapping digital and cultural territories in real-time.

My responsibilities spanned product architecture, data strategy, R&D planning, and full-stack coordination of mobile (iOS/Android), web, and backend systems. I also led stakeholder reporting, academic submissions, usability testing, and team coordination with engineers, designers, and external partners. The platform reached over 1.7 million mapped zones, incorporating data visualization, community tagging, SEO optimization, and user-generated content pipelines.

This role combined scientific research with practical product execution, bridging academic rigor and startup-level agility. I collaborated with FAPESP reviewers and advisors while maintaining delivery standards, impact measurement, and technical documentation.

This experience deepened my understanding of applied research, large-scale digital systems, and the intersection of public innovation and product development.
